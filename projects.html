Moreover, teaching myself how to create this website is a demonstration of my hard working nature, initiative, and problem solving capabilities. The website uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a visually appealing, interactive website. I also employed concepts I learned in my UI design class such as the principles of design and Gestalt principles.
